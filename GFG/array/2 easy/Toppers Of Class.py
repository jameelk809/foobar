"""
There is a class of N students and the task is to find the top K marks scorers.
You need to print the index of the toppers of the class which will be same as the
index of the student in the input array (use 0-based indexing). First print the
index of the students having highest marks then the students with second highest
and so on. If there are more than one students having same marks then print their
indices in ascending order.Suppose k = 2 and the students having highest marks have
indices 0 and 5 and students having second highest marks have indices 6 and 7 then
output will be 0 5 6 7.
